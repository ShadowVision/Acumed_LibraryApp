                    The Acumed Polarus 3 Solution has been designed to offer plate and nail options to treat proximal humerus fractures. The system is comprised of instrumentation to perform both plate and nail surgeries. While they are provided together for convenience, a plate and nail should not be used on the same fracture. The system introduces a number of improvements to the implants as well as advancements in instrumentation. The information included in this surgical technique provides the recommended procedures for implantation and removal. The Instructions For Use (IFU) for Polarus 3 can be found in PKGI-56 and PKGI-67.
