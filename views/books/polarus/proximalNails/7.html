                Insert the nail over the guide wire. Verify that the
proximal end of the nail is at least 5 mm below the
cortex to avoid impingement. The nail should be inserted
with hand pressure. Once proper depth is achieved, the nail
and targeting guide may be rotated up to 20&deg; to both align
the screws with the bone fragments and to avoid the biceps
tendon. To avoid injury to the axillary nerve, do not insert the
nail more than 10 mm deep relative to the cortex. If a good
A/P image of the humeral head is viewed, the forearm can be
locked at approximately 30&deg; of external rotation. Using a K&dash;wire
in the hole marked &ldquo;30&deg; retroversion&rdquo; in the targeting guide will
indicate this angle.

                Marks on the barrel of the targeting connector are a
reference for the surgeon that the nail is either 5 mm or 10 mm
below the cortex. The depth of the nail may also be verified
by inserting a 2.0 mm Guide Wire (WS&dash;2009ST) through the
small hole located below the knob on the targeting guide.
Under fluoroscopy, the wire will point to the top of the nail. It is
important that the C&dash;arm is exactly parallel to the arm to obtain
an accurate image of implant depth.
