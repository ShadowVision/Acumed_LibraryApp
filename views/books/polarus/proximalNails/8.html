                The same type of screw is used in every
hole, there are no nonlocking screws. The locking
behavior of a screw is determined by the hole it is inserted
into. The proximal PEEK insert will create locking friction as
the screw threads into it. Small burrs may form during screw
insertion into PEEK, but these should remain contained inside
the nail.

                The cannula will lock into the targeting guide when the
arrow and flat are facing up. This locking action can be used
to assist with reduction of the fracture and to hold fragments
reduced. To unlock the cannula, turn it a quarter-turn to the left
or right.

                The diagram to the left shows the suggested
order of screw insertion. Starting with the most anterior screw
position, insert the cannula and targeting awl through the
targeting guide and through a stab incision over the target site.
Lightly tap the awl with the Multiple Contact Hammer (80&dash;1538)
to create a small indentation in the bone to assist with targeting
accuracy. Only light tapping should be used on the awl to avoid
splitting the cortex.

                Remove the awl and insert the drill guide through the cannula
and up to the bone surface. The drill guide should be flush to
the surface. Before drilling, be sure the guide wire is removed.
Utilizing a Polarus 3 2.8 mm Long Drill (Sharp: 80&dash;1624 or
Blunt: 80&dash;1634), prepare the bone for screw insertion. Both a
traditional sharp drill and a blunt&dash;tipped drill are available. The
blunt drill can be used to help avoid perforation of the joint
surface at the far cortex. Care should be taken not to over&dash;drill
with either drill. Use the laser mark on the drill with the scale on
the back of the drill guide to determine the appropriate screw
length. If the screw size reading is between sizes, round down
to the shorter size.

                Prior to inserting the screw, remove the drill guide. Using the
Polarus 3 Long T15 Hexalobe Driver (80&dash;1618) insert a 4.3 mm
screw of the appropriate length. The insertion torque of the
screw into the nail may increase as the screw engages the
internal locking sleeve of the nail. This resistance will lock the
screw into position. When the groove on the driver shaft aligns
with the end of the cannula, the screw head is approaching the
bone. Care should be taken not to advance screws into the
articular surface.

Cannula (80&dash;1792) is required to insert a washer and this
cannula will not lock like the ratcheting cannula.
