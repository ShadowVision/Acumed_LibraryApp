                It is important to lock the distal humerus
in the correct amount of retroversion relative
to the humeral head. The fragments can be rotated under
fluoroscopy until the fragments are restored to their anatomical
positioning. If a good A&frasl;P image of the humeral head is viewed,
the forearm can be locked at approximately 30&deg; of external
rotation. Using a K&dash;wire in the hole marked &ldquo;30&deg; retroversion&rdquo; in
the targeting guide will indicate this angle.

                Insert the cannula and targeting awl into the most distal hole
in the targeting guide. Lightly tap the awl against the bone
to create a dimple. The drill guide is then inserted through
the cannula. Using the long drill, drill through both cortices.
Leaving this &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; drill engaged will help to preserve
the positioning of the distal fragment. Place another cannula
into the other distal hole and dimple the bone with the awl. Use
a second drill to drill through both cortices.

                The distal holes are angled relative to the bone by 15&deg;
