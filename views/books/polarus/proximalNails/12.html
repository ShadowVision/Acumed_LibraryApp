                It is important to close the rotator cuff after
insertion of the nail. A permanent suture
such as Number 2 Ethibond may be utilized to close the rotator
cuff. Generally, two figure&dash;8 sutures are used to close the small
longitudinal incision of the rotator cuff. After this the deltoid
is closed. The wound is then closed in layers with the deltoid
closed with Number One Vicryl or similar absorbable suture
and the skin is closed in standard fashion.
