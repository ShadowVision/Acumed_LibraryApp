                Postoperatively, the patient is placed in an
                arm sling and a pain pump may be placed in
                the sub&dash;acromial space to help with postoperative pain relief.
                The patient is started on pendulum motion exercises at one to
                two weeks, a passive motion program for two to six weeks, and
                active strengthening at six weeks when evident signs of healing
                are seen.

                If removal of the implant is desired, prepare the exposure as
                in Step 2. Locate the screws under fluoroscopy and remove
                only the proximal screws with the T15 hexalobe driver. If
                Acumed drivers are unavailable, the hexalobe screws may
                be removed with a T15 hexalobe connection. Use the tip of
                the Polarus&reg; C Removal Instrument (80-1546) to remove any
                ingrown tissue in the head of the nail. Remove the cap screw
                using the cap screw driver. Screw the removal instrument into
                the nail. The threaded portion of the removal tool has cutting
                flutes that will remove tissue as it is inserted. The tip will fit
                into the cannulation to prevent cross threading. The removal
                instrument will not point straight down the humeral shaft, but
                will angle laterally about 4&deg;.

                After verifying that the distal screws have been removed, slip

                instrument and break the nail loose with short, sharp blows.
                The hammer has two sides, one of which has a 20&deg; offset.
