                Please use the diagram for the suggested
                order of screw insertion. The first proximal screw placed
                should be the anterior screw second from the top
                (see image, &num;1) on the plate. Utilizing a Polarus 3 2.8 mm Short
                Drill (Sharp: 80&dash;1592 or Blunt: 80&dash;1597), prepare the bone for
                screw insertion. Both a traditional sharp drill and a blunt-tipped
                drill are available. The blunt drill can be used to help avoid
                perforation of the joint surface at the far cortex. Care should be
                taken not to over&dash;drill with either drill. Drill the hole and utilize
                the laser mark on the drill with the scale on the back of the
                drop&dash;in plate drill guide to determine the appropriate screw
                length. Screw depth can also be measured with the depth
                gauge through the targeting guide.

                For accurate determination, be sure that the drill guide is fully
seated into the targeting guide. The Locking Drill Guide is
also available, but requires a second measurement step using
the depth gauge, through the targeting guide. Using the T15
hexalobe driver, insert a low&dash;profile hexalobe screw of the
appropriate length.
