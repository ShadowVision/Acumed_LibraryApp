                Sharply dissect down to the level of the fascia and elevate
                the skin flaps. Identify the cephalic vein and develop the
                interval between the deltoid and the pectoralis. Retract
                the cephalic vein laterally and the pectoralis major
                medially. Release the fascia along the lateral border of
                the coracobrachialis and retract it medially to expose the
                proximal humerus with the subscapularis tendon attachment.
                To help facilitate reduction and improve fracture visualization,
                release the superior one-third of the pectoralis major from
                the shaft. It is important to place a finger underneath the
                pectoralis major as it is being released to protect the biceps
                tendon, which lies directly underneath

                Either a bra strap (with reflection of a distally-based skin flap)
                incision or a direct lateral skin incision can be used. The
                deltoid is split and reflected off the acromion proximally. The
                axillary nerve is identified and carefully protected. The nerve
                is often located approximately 5.6 cm from the apex of the
                humeral head and 6.9 cm from the acromion.<sup>1</sup>

                Two soft-tissue windows are created through the deltoid
                above and below the area where the axillary nerve passes.
                The upper window is used for fracture reduction, plate
                insertion and insertion of proximal screws into the plate. The
                lower window is used to ensure the plate is properly seated
                on the shaft of the humerus and to allow insertion of the
                distal screws.
