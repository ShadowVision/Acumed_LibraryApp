Plate (Left: 80&dash;1589 or Right: 80&dash;1590) and secure it to the
plate with the Polarus 3 Plate Targeting Locking Bolt (80&dash;1591),
utilizing the thumb grip.

                If the Posterior Plate is used, Polarus 3 Plate Drill Guides,
Locking (80&dash;1588) can be used to adjust the angle of the two
posterior tabs prior to screw placement.

                Place the plate approximately 5 mm posterior to the bicipital
groove and approximately 8&dash;10 mm inferior to the top of the
greater tuberosity. Confirm fracture reduction and plate height
fluoroscopically. When proper reduction and positioning are
obtained, provisionally secure the plate to the bone with
2.0 mm Guide Wires (WS&dash;2009ST), the Polarus 3 Reduction
Device (80&dash;1601), Ball Spike Reduction Tool (80&dash;1637), or
Polarus 3 Plate Tacks (80&dash;1595). The reduction device should
be used in the longest oblong slot to avoid blocking access to
other screw holes. The Polarus 3 K&dash;wire Guide (80&dash;1600) is also
available to assist with the placement of K-wires.

                Sutures may be utilized at this time to improve construct
stability. The plate features suture holes to address greater
tuberosity fragments in three and four&dash;part fractures. The
targeting guide contains a suture cleat which can be used to
temporarily maintain tension on the suture. This should be
used with care to avoid damaging the suture integrity.
