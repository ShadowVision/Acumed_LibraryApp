                If removal of the implant is desired, prepare the exposure as
                in Step 3. Locate the screws and remove them with the T15
                hexalobe driver, then remove the plate. If Acumed drivers are
                unavailable, the hexalobe screws may be removed with a T15
                hexalobe connection. The Acumed Screw Removal System
                can also assist removal.
