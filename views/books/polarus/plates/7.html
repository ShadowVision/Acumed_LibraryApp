                The same type of screw is used in every
hole, there are no nonlocking screws. The locking
behavior of a screw is determined by the hole it is inserted
into. Round, threaded holes are locking, oblong slots are
nonlocking. Take care to remove any burrs which may have
formed during screw insertion.

                    To prepare the bone, use the Polarus 3 Plate Drill Guide,
Drop-In (80&dash;1587) and the Polarus 3 2.8 mm Surgibit&reg; Short Drill
(80&dash;1592), using the laser band to determine the appropriate
length of screw. Screw depth can also be measured with the
Polarus 3 Depth Gauge (80&dash;1776).

                    Using the T15 Stick-Fit Hexalobe Driver (80&dash;0760) insert a
4.3 mm Low&dash;profile Hexalobe Screw (3011&dash;430XX&dash;S) of the
appropriate length. The screw may be inserted through any
oblong slot in the plate distal to the fracture. Ensure that the
screw is fully seated into the plate. The second slot is the
longest and will allow for the most adjustment.

                Oblong slots do not provide the option to lock screws to
the plate. Screws lengths of 20&dash;32 mm are commonly used in
the shaft. If dense bone is encountered, the Polarus 3 4.3 mm
Screw Tap (80&dash;1623) and Polarus 3 Tap Sleeve (80&dash;1593) may
be used to further prepare the bone for screw insertion.
