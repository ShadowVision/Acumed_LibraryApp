                Insert the nail over the guide wire. Verify that the
                proximal end of the nail is at least 5 mm below
                the cortex to avoid impingement. The nail should be inserted
                with hand pressure. Once proper depth is achieved, the nail
                and targeting guide may be rotated up to 20 degrees to both
                align the screws with the bone fragments and to avoid the
                biceps tendon. To avoid injury to the axillary nerve, do not
                insert the nail more than 10 mm deep relative to the cortex.

                Marks on the barrel of the targeting connector are
                a reference for the surgeon that the nail is either 5 mm or
                10 mm below the cortex. The depth of the nail may also be
                verified by inserting a 2.0 mm K-wire through the small hole
                located just above the center hole on the targeting guide.
                Under fluoroscopy, the wire will point to the top of the nail.
                It is important that the C&dash;arm is exactly parallel to the arm to
                obtain an accurate image of implant depth.

                The cannula will lock into the targeting guide when the

                reduced. To unlock the cannula, turn it a quarter-turn to the

                The diagram on the following page shows the recommended
                order of screw insertion. Starting with the most anterior screw
                position, insert the cannula and targeting awl through the
                targeting guide and through a stab incision over the target
                site. Lightly tap the awl with the Multiple Contact Hammer
                (80&dash;1538) to create a small indentation in the bone to assist
                with targeting accuracy. Only light tapping should be used on
                the awl to avoid splitting the cortex.

                Remove the awl and insert the drill guide through the cannula
                and up to the bone surface. The drill guide should be flush
                to the surface. Before drilling, be sure the guide wire is
                removed. Utilizing the Polarus&reg; C 2.8 mm Drill (Sharp/Blunt:
                80&dash;1624/80&dash;1634), prepare the bone for screw insertion. Both
                a traditional sharp drill and a blunt&dash;tipped drill are available.
                The blunt drill can be used to help avoid perforation of the
                joint surface at the far cortex. Care should be taken not to
                over&dash;drill with either drill. Use the laser mark on the drill with
                the scale on the back of the drill guide to determine the
                appropriate screw length. If the screw size reading is between
                sizes, round down to the shorter size.

                Prior to inserting the screw, remove the drill guide. Using
                the Polarus&reg; C Long T15 Hexalobe Driver (80&dash;1618) insert a
                4.3 mm Screw of the appropriate length. The insertion torque
                of the screw into the nail may increase as the screw engages
                the internal locking sleeve of the nail. This resistance will
                lock the screw into position. When the groove on the driver
                shaft aligns with the end of the cannula, the screw head is
                approaching the bone.
