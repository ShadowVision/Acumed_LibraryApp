                In order to target either the M&frasl;L or A&frasl;P distal screws,
locate the distal screw hole utilizing fluoroscopy. Care should
be taken to avoid damaging the radial nerve when making
the incision for the distal interlocking screws when the M&frasl;L
approach is used. Careful spreading of tissue and retraction
down to the bone will minimize injury to the nerve and improve
visibility of the screw insertion site. Using a C&dash;arm and the
Freehand Targeting Guide (MS&dash;0210), find the bottom of the
most distal slot. Stand up the Freehand Guide and tap it to
create a starting dimple. Place the Polarus 3 2.8mm Surgibit&reg;
Short Drill (80&dash;1592), and Polarus 3 Plate Drill Guide, Drop-In
(80&dash;1587) into the dimple and drill parallel with the C-arm beam.
Leaving this &ldquo;placeholder&rdquo; drill engaged will help to preserve
the positioning of the distal fragment during compression.
Leaving the drill in the bottom of the distal slot, apply manual
compression if necessary
