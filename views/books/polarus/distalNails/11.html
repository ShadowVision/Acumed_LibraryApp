                arm sling and a pain pump may be placed in
                the sub&dash;acromial space to help with postoperative pain relief.
                The patient is started on pendulum motion exercises at one to
                two weeks, a passive motion program for two to six weeks, and
                active strengthening at six weeks when evident signs of healing
                are seen.

                If removal of the implant is desired, prepare the exposure as in
Step 2. Locate the screws under fluoroscopy and remove only
the proximal screws with the T15 hexalobe driver. If Acumed
drivers are unavailable, the hexalobe screws may be removed
with a T15 hexalobe connection.

                Use the tip of the Polarus 3 Removal Instrument (80&dash;1546)
to remove any ingrown tissue in the head of the nail.
Remove the cap screw using the Polarus 3 Cap Screw Driver
(80&dash;1635). Thread the removal instrument into the nail. The
threaded portion of the removal instrument has cutting flutes
that will remove tissue as it is inserted. The tip will fit into
the cannulation to prevent cross threading. The removal
instrument will not point straight down the humeral shaft, but
will angle laterally about 4&deg;.
