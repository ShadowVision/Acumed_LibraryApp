                The implant insertion point is located approximately
10 mm posterior to the bicipital groove, just medial
to the greater tuberosity. For three&dash;part fractures, care should
be taken to make the starting point at the junction of the
articular surface and the greater tuberosity.

                The trocar tip guide wire can be advanced into the canal
as a guide for subsequent steps. The tip of the Polarus 3
Cannulated Awl (80&dash;1551) should be carefully buried over the
guide wire no deeper than 30 mm below the bone surface to
create an entry hole 10 mm in diameter. The groove on the
awl is approximately 50 mm from the tip. If the fracture runs
through the insertion site, it may be necessary to create a
starting hole with a burr or rongeur.

                The guide wire position should be verified with images in
both the A&frasl;P and oblique planes to ensure that the guide wire
is inside the humerus and in the canal. Fluoroscopy can be
utilized to ensure that the guide wire has not exited through
the fracture site.

                A drill bit may also be used in the proximal fragment as
a joystick to aid fracture reduction and realignment. The drill
should be positioned to avoid interference with both the nail
and targeting guide during insertion.
